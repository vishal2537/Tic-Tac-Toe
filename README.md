# TicTactoe

Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Tkinter and Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The game also utilizes the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to provide an optimized AI opponent.

# Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The first player uses "X" as their symbol, and the second player uses "O". The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Graphical user interface using Tkinter for an interactive experience.
Human vs. AI gameplay, where the AI opponent utilizes the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
Randomized AI moves when multiple optimal moves are available.
Game board display with clickable cells for making moves.
End game detection and result display.

# Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm

The Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm is a search algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree by eliminating branches that are guaranteed to be worse than previously evaluated branches. This algorithm improves the efficiency of the AI opponent's decision-making process.
